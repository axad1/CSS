/* 
position: static|relative|fixed|absolute|sticky

static: one after other

relative: positioned relative to its normal position
Other content will not be adjusted to fit any gap

fixed: positioned relative to the viewport
always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled

absolute: positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements

sticky: relative and fixed positioned based on the user's scroll position
It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport
then it "sticks" in place like fixed
You must also specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work

Elements are then positioned using the top, bottom, left,and right properties.
However, these properties will not work unless the position property is set first.
