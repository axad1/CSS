block elements
To center an image, set left and right margin to auto and make it into a block element

2. text-align: center

3. position: absolute
use left, right, top, bottom
Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements

Note: If an element is taller than the element containing it,
and it is floated, it will overflow outside of its container.
You can use the "clearfix hack" to fix this
