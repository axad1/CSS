for animations
Use setInterval() if the animation isnâ€™t in real-time and should just happen at regular intervals.
Favor CSS if the animation happens in real-time and can be managed with it.
Use requestAnimationFrame() for any other case.


#frame {
  border: 1px solid red;
}

#block {
  width: 20px;
  height: 40px;
  background: red;
  position: relative;
  margin-left: -20px; /* Negative margin to simplify position calculations */
  animation-name: moveBlock; /* Name of animation */
  animation-duration: 3s; /* Length of animation */
  animation-fill-mode: forwards; /* Let the block in its final position */
}

@keyframes moveBlock {
  from {
    /* Initial position: to the left of the frame (taking negative margin into account) */
    left: 20px;
  }
  to {
    /* Final position: within the right side of the frame (taking negative margin into account) */
    left: 100%;
  }
